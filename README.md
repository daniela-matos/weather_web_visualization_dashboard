Web Visualization Dashboard - Using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
This website attempts to answer the question - What's the weather like as we approach the equator? 
The data was pulled from OpenWeatherMap API and for the analysis I compared four environmental factors: temperature, humidity, cloudiness and windspeed. 

To create the webpage I used this website as reference:
